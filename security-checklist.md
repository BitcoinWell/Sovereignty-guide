# Security checklist

### Wallet setup checklist

* [ ] Choose a reputable wallet (hardware wallet recommended for significant amounts).
* [ ] Buy the wallet from the official source (avoid secondhand devices).
* [ ] Verify the integrity of the device (check for tampering, compare to photos on official site).
* [ ] Follow the setup guide carefully.
* [ ] Generate your seed phrase securely (use the device's entropy if possible).
* [ ] Write down the seed phrase clearly and double-check it.
* [ ] Store the seed phrase securely (offline, multiple locations, consider engraving on metal).
* [ ] Set a strong PIN or passphrase on the device.
* [ ] Enable 2FA or a password if the option exists.
* [ ] Backup the wallet if it allows for it.

### Backup checklist

* [ ] Ensure you have your seed phrase written down clearly and correctly.
* [ ] Store the seed phrase in multiple secure locations (home safe, bank vault, with a trusted family member).
* [ ] Consider engraving the seed phrase on a metal plate for durability.
* [ ] If using a software wallet, make sure you have a backup of the wallet file as well.
* [ ] Set calendar reminders to periodically check on your backups.
* [ ] Have a plan for your backups in case of emergency situations (fire, flood, etc.).
* [ ] Ensure your trusted contacts know how to access your backups in case something happens to you.
