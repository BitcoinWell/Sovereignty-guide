# Troubleshooting & FAQ

## Common issues and solutions

#### Issue: Transaction stuck or unconfirmed

* Solution: Check the fee rate of your transaction. If it's too low, it may take a long time to confirm or may get stuck. You can try to replace the transaction with a higher fee (RBF) or wait for it to eventually confirm or be dropped from the mempool.

#### Issue: Wallet not syncing

* Solution: Check your internet connection and make sure your wallet software is up to date. If using a full node wallet, make sure your node is synced and the wallet is connected to it. If the issue persists, try resetting the wallet or restarting the syncing process.

#### Issue: Missing funds after restore from seed

* Solution: Make sure you've entered the seed words correctly. If you had a passphrase on the old wallet, make sure to enter it as well. If you're still missing funds, try restoring the seed in a different wallet software. Some wallets may not correctly derive all address types.

#### Issue: Hardware wallet not recognized

* Solution: Ensure your hardware wallet firmware is up to date. Try a different USB cable and port. If using a web wallet, ensure the browser is up to date and has the necessary permissions to access USB devices.

#### Issue: Lost 2FA device

* Solution: If you've lost your 2FA device, you'll need to go through your service's account recovery process. This usually involves proving your identity and may take several days. Always store your 2FA backup codes to avoid this situation.

Remember, many issues can be prevented with proper setup and maintenance. Always keep your software updated, use strong and unique passwords, and regularly test your backups and recovery processes.

Personal recommendation: If you run into an issue that you can't solve, don't panic. Reach out to the support channels for your wallet or service, or ask for help in reputable Bitcoin forums or communities. There's usually a solution, and the Bitcoin community is generally very helpful.
